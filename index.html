        <p>Hello, my name is Briggitte Segovia and I am 18 years old. I was born into the era of technology so it was fun seeing the progression it had even though it was advanced. This is the first time I'm in web development with coding involved. I took the course CIS160 which was with WordPress and the class was pretty fun. I hope this class is just as fun or maybe even better. I am new to all of this so I hope I can learn as much as I can before the course ends and actually keep up with the knowledge I gain.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>I crochet stuffed plushies friends asked me for.</li>
            <li>I play video games with friends</li>
            <li>Lastly, I try to improve my rollerskating...(without breaking a bone).</li>
        </ul>     
        <p>My favorite website is <a href="https://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a> because I can watch some of my favorite k-dramas and talk about them with my friends.</p>
